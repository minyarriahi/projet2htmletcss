    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl. Beat the eggs with salt and pepper until they are well mixed and have a uniform color.</li>
        <li>Heat the butter or oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat until melted.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs into the skillet. Tilt the skillet to spread the eggs evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the omelette. As the eggs begin to set, gently push the edges towards the center using a spatula, allowing uncooked eggs to flow to the edges.</li>
        <li>Add fillings. Once the eggs are mostly set, add your desired fillings to one side of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Fold the omelette. Carefully fold the omelette in half with a spatula and cook for an additional minute or until the cheese is melted and the eggs are fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately. Slide the omelette onto a plate and enjoy!</li>
